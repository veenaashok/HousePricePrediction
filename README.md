# HousePricePrediction
To predict the actual value of housing properties
A US-based housing company has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. Predict the actual value of the prospective properties to decide whether to invest in them or not.
The company wants to know:
  - Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
  - How well those variables describe the price of a house.
